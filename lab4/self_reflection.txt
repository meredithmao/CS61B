All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: The way you resized the array was much more efficient than how I did mine. 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I could have used helper methods when it came to calculating. Instead I had ugly calculations which made it look very long and tedious. 

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would use more comment lines to allow for cleaner and better understandings.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I was proud of how quickly I was able to finished LinedListDeque. 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I understood the fundamentals of linked lists better but through doing the project it definetely helped me. 

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I definetely do! It helps me reevaluate the way that I code things and helps me understand better how to improve.
